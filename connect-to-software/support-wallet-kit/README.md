# Support Wallet Kits

If your project already uses a wallet aggregator/kit, you can keep using it and prioritize OneKey in their configuration. The following popular kits support OneKey:

- [Web3 Onboard (EVM)](web3-onboard.md)
- [RainbowKit (EVM)](rainbowkit.md)
- [Web3Modal (EVM)](web3modal.md)
- [Aptos Wallet Adapter (Aptos)](aptos-wallet-adapter.md)

For pure web without aggregators, see: [JavaScript (EIP‑1193)](../webapp-connect-onekey/README.md).
